The purpose of this task is to deal with many potential errors that may occur
when writing code. Becoming familiar with them now means they won't be scary in
the future. In this exercise, you will work with broken code that you will have
to fix.

The application simulates a lottery and is a simple game. For the needs of the
task, the code was scattered over several modules and packages, and it is their
proper handling that has the most errors and problems.
